## The Opportunity

**Problem:** Job searching is broken. 75% of resumes never reach humans (ATS filtering), the average search takes 5-6 months, and quality career coaching costs $100-500/hour. Job seekers juggle 5-7 disconnected tools with no strategic framework.

**Solution:** Career Playbook is an AI-powered career coaching platform that combines strategic planning, resume optimization, job tracking, and mentorship in one integrated solution - for $9.99/month.
