## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### Job Searching is Broken

**The Statistics:**
- 75% of resumes never reach human recruiters (filtered by ATS)
- Average job search takes 5-6 months
- Job seekers use 5-7 different tools (spreadsheets, resume builders, job boards)
- 67% of job seekers don't have a structured plan
- $10,000+ average cost of career coaching

**The Pain Points:**
1. **Fragmented Tools** - Resume builder here, job tracker there, spreadsheets everywhere
2. **No Strategy** - Reactive job hunting instead of proactive career planning
3. **Expensive Coaching** - Quality guidance costs $100-500/hour
4. **ATS Black Hole** - Resumes rejected before humans see them
5. **No Accountability** - Solo job search leads to motivation loss

*"Job seekers need a coach, not just tools."*
